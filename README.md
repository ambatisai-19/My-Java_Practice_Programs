# My-Java_Practice_Programs
 Here, I’m practicing Core Java, which includes Java basics such as syntax, data types, and control structures. I’m also exploring OOP concepts like designing with objects and classes, focusing on principles like encapsulation and inheritance. Additionally, I’m working on DSA to efficiently organize data and solve problems with algorithms.
 1)Introduction to Java

History and Features
Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
2)Basic Syntax and Data Types

Variables and Data Types
Operators and Expressions
Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
3)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and Objects
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Encapsulation and Abstraction
4)Methods and Arrays

Defining and Calling Methods
Method Overloading and Overriding
Arrays and Multidimensional Arrays
5)Exception Handling

Try, Catch, Finally Blocks
Throwing and Creating Custom Exceptions
6)File I/O

Reading and Writing Files
Serialization
7)Collections Framework

Lists, Sets, Maps
Iterators and Generics
8)Multithreading and Concurrency

Threads and Runnable Interface
Synchronization and Concurrency Utilities
9)Java Standard Libraries

String Handling
Utility Classes (e.g., Date, Calendar)
10)Database Connectivity (JDBC)

Connecting to Databases
Executing Queries and Updates
